# 10 Essential Web Development Tips for 2025

Web development continues to evolve rapidly, and staying up-to-date with best practices is crucial for building modern, efficient, and maintainable applications. Here are 10 essential tips that every web developer should consider in 2025.

## 1. Embrace Semantic HTML

Semantic HTML is the foundation of accessible and SEO-friendly websites. Instead of using generic `<div>` elements everywhere, use meaningful HTML elements that describe their content.

### Bad Example:
```html
<div class="header">
  <div class="nav">
    <div class="nav-item">Home</div>
    <div class="nav-item">About</div>
  </div>
</div>
